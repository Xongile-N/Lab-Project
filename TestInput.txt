Figure 9-2, where the received bits are 00. For each state transition, the number on the arc
shows the branch metric for that transition. Two of the branch metrics are 0, corresponding
to the only states and transitions where the corresponding Hamming distance is 0. The
other non-zero branch metrics correspond to cases when there are bit errors.
The path metric is a value associated with a state in the trellis (i.e., a value associated
with each node). For hard decision decoding, it corresponds to the Hamming distance
over the most likely path from the initial state to the current state in the trellis. By “most
likely”, we mean the path with smallest Hamming distance between the initial state and
the current state, measured over all possible paths between the two states. The path with
the smallest Hamming distance minimizes the total number of bit errors, and is most likely
when the BER is low.
The key insight in the Viterbi algorithm is that the receiver can compute the path metric
for a (state, time) pair incrementally using the path metrics of previously computed states
and the branch metrics.
